rdio-simple for PHP

An Rdio client including a built-in OAuth implementation.

Requirements:
  PHP5
  curl

To install the library simply add the om.php and rdio.php files to your source
directory.

Usage:
To use the library just require the rdio.php file in your PHP source file:
  require 'rdio.php';
Create an Rdio instance passing in an array with your consumer key and secret:
  $rdio = new Rdio(array("consumerkey", "consumersecret"));
Make API calls with the call(methodname, params) method:
  $rdio->call('get', keys='a254895,a104386')
Authenticate and authorize with the begin_authentication and
complete_authentication methods.

The current token (either request or access) is stored in $rdio->token as an
array with the token and token secret.

Note: PHP does not support unicode but the Rdio API always expects UTF-8
strings. If your strings are in latin-1 then you'll have to encode them to
UTF-8 using PHP's utf8_encode function before passing them into the library.

Examples:
Both examples authenticate and then list the user's playlists. They use
credentials stored in rdio-consumer-credentials.php.

  examples/web-based.php
